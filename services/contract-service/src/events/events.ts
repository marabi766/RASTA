/**
 * Events published by contract-service, on `rasta.contract.v1`.
 *
 * `CONTRACT_DRAFTED` is the one event of CON-003 PR 1: the draft a tender award
 * created. The catalogue (`docs/04` § 4.13) named `CONTRACT_CREATED` with an
 * `amount`; ADR-068 § 4 defines `CONTRACT_DRAFTED` in its place, without the amount
 * (the project manager names it and accepts the change).
 *
 * The payloads are defined here because this service owns them (ADR-032); the
 * only cross-service contract in `packages/contracts` is the audit trail.
 *
 * ## What these payloads never carry
 *
 * **Identifiers and instants only — no amount, no free text, no personal data.**
 * The topic is read by every service that declares a subscription, and by
 * audit-service in full (`docs/07` § 7.3). The contract's price is the winner's bid
 * price, which `TENDER_AWARDED` itself does not carry (round 1 of #199); a consumer
 * that needs it asks this service's API under its own authorization.
