/**
 * Models carrying an `organizationId` and therefore scoped automatically.
 *
 * Listed explicitly, because the two directions of a mistake are not
 * symmetrical: a model wrongly listed produces an immediate, obvious query
 * error, while a model wrongly omitted produces a silent cross-tenant read.
 *
 * Every table holding maintenance data is here, including the cost lines —
 * `MaintenanceCost` is the record economic-service will eventually settle
 * from, and an unscoped read of it would be a leak of one organization's
 * spending to another.
 *
 * `AssetRef` and `AssetUsageMeter` are the deliberate exceptions. Both are
 * platform-wide reference data replicated from other services' events, written
 * by consumers that have no request context to scope against, and — the part
 * that matters — neither is ever consulted for an authorization decision.
 * Every access-control answer in this service comes from the verified token
 * and from `organizationId` on this service's own rows.
